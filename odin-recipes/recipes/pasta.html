<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
	<li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
	<li>¼ cup butter</li>
	<li>1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix</li>
	<li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup</li>
	<li>½ cup white wine</li>
	<li>4 ounces cream cheese with chives</li>
	<li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
</ul>

<strong>Steps</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
	<li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine.<br>
		Add cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.</li>
	<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour.<br> 
		An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
	<li>About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil.<br>
		Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
	<li>Serve chicken and sauce over pasta.</li>
