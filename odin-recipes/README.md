## Odin Recipe

When I started Odin Project course this is my first work in the introduction 
where I needed to create a page that has some of my favorite food recipes in there with ingredients and instructions.

Here I have only used HTML, and the teaching of these was unordered/ordered list and href (Hypertext Reference).
Also, the idea is to understand the elements and tags.
