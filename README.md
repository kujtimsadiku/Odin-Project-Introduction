# Odin-Project-Introduction

### Odin Project Fullstack Course

Odin Project is a free full-stack course. The project starts with an introduction (what is HTML, CSS, JavaScript? etc.) and
learning the basics of HTML and CSS. After you have finished the introduction, you can choose your learning path (Ruby or JavaScript).

Here I'm going to be committing my work thru the introduction.
